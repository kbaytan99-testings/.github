# Enterprise Develop

Independent technical testing organization focused on **architecture-driven backend evaluation**
and **testing strategy assessment** for companies.

This organization hosts technical exercises, test repositories, and experimentation
environments used to validate architectural decisions and system design quality.

## Focus Areas
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- SOLID principles
- Clean Architecture
- REST API design
- Backend system evaluation

## Purpose
Repositories under this organization are created for:
- Company technical exercises
- Architecture and design validation
- Testing strategy experimentation
- Interview and assessment processes

The goal is to demonstrate **how systems are designed, tested, and evaluated** rather
than focusing on specific frameworks or implementations.
